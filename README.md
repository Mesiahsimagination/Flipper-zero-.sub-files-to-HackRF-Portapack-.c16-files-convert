# Flipper-zero-.sub-files-to-HackRF-portapack-.c16-files-convert-
This script should convert the .sub file to a .c16 file that can be loaded onto a HackRF device. 
Please note that the sample rate of the output .c16 file will be the same as the sample rate of the input .sub file. 
If you need to adjust the sample rate, you may need to modify the script accordingly.
To use it open cmd or terminal and use this command python convert_sub_to_c16.py input.sub output.c16
